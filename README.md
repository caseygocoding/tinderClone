# Tinder for Pets - A tinder clone
I created this app for my stackahaton project. The app is a clone of the popular dating app, Tinder. where users were able to swipe left or right to match with other users. 

The tech stacks I used in this project included: 
1. Firebase for realtime database as well as user authentication.
2. React-native for mobile frontEnd development
3. GeoHash to detech users' current location (the app matches users that are within 20km with each other)
4. AWS S3 to store users' uploaded pictures
5. Integrated chat feature within the app
6. Push notification
